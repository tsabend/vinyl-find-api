# # Sample configuration:
# config = {
#   :access_token => 'tk',  # initialize the client with an access token to perform authenticated calls
#   :raise_errors => true,  # choose between returning false or raising a proper exception when API calls fails
#
#   # Connection properties
#   :retries       => 0,    # automatically retry a certain number of times before returning
#   :read_timeout  => 10,   # set longer read_timeout, default is 10 seconds
#   :write_timeout => 10,   # set longer write_timeout, default is 10 seconds
#   :persistent    => false # when true, make multiple requests calls using a single persistent connection. Use +close_connection+ method on the client to manually clean up sockets
# }
# client = Spotify::Client.new(config)
# or with default options:
$Spotify = Spotify::Client.new
